    "prompt": "Pakistan has faced significant political insecurity throughout its history. Several factors contribute to this insecurity, including internal power struggles, regional conflicts, religious extremism, and socio-economic challenges. Pakistan has experienced multiple military coups and interventions since its independence in 1947. The military has directly ruled the country for long periods, undermining civilian governance and democratic institutions. These interventions have created an atmosphere of political instability and uncertainty. Pakistan is a diverse country with various ethnic and regional groups. Tensions between different ethnicities and provinces have led to political instability. Balochistan, for example, has witnessed a long-standing separatist movement due to perceived political and economic marginalization. ",

It encompasses a range of strategies and precautions designed to ensure the safety, well-being, and privacy of an individual. In other words, personal security aims to create a sense of safety and reduce the vulnerability of individuals to physical harm, theft, privacy breaches, and other threats to their well-being.
